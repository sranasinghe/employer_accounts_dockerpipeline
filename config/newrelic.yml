  #============================== Browser Monitoring ===============================
  # New Relic Real User Monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are
  # experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for
  # your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount
  # of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page.
  browser_monitoring:
      # By default the agent automatically injects the monitoring JavaScript
      # into web pages. Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior.

# Environment-specific settings are in this section.
